Paper++ workout tracker

---

The core of this application is to be a digital logbook. It was born out of frustration with the
bombardment of features in fitness applications when all I really ever wanted was a convenient way
to log and track workouts. My needs were better met by a piece of paper than most fitness apps and
so this is a way to actually meet those needs.

At its core what it should do is allow you to create exercises, then group and schedule those as
workouts. The details on the exercises are minimal, you're expected to know what you are doing and
use this to track that.

What will always be included:
 - Create / edit exercises
 - Create / edit workouts
 - Logging workouts
 - View exercise history
 - Set the plate / bar weight for each exercise
 - No enforced databases / programs; user controls everything.
