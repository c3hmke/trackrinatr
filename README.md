Paper++ workout tracker, started as a way to play with dart apps. Figured I may as well make something
useful to myself. Eventually canned it because monetizing the app seems to defeat the purpose and the
yearly iOS developer fee was much too high to justify without monetization.

The core of this application is to be a digital logbook. It was born out of frustration with the
bombardment of features in fitness applications when all I really ever wanted was a convenient way
to log and track workouts. My needs were better met by a piece of paper than most fitness apps and
so this is a way to actually meet those needs.

At its core what it should do is allow you to create exercises, then group and schedule those as
workouts. The details on the exercises are minimal, you're expected to know what you are doing and
use this to track that.
